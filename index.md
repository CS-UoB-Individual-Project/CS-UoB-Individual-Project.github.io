## Viva Dates

Most vivas will be held on the 19th and 20th May 2026 in Bristol. Treat these dates as an exam, i.e. you should be free for these dates.  Because of staff availability, a small number of vivas will be held outside these dates, so **you MUST be in Bristol for the full summer assessment period, 4th April to 22nd May 2026**.

Note that vivas are being planned to be **in-person**.

## Projects list
The list of Projects is [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/grp-2025-6IndividualProjects_ojufi7-StaffRoom/ETFY0C4wYLlFoH8kwhoooFUBCahjihovB4RZ3E2KHyexVg?e=Awdq2a)

Once you have agreed a project with your supervisor, you must complete [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/dMycuMNQiz) by **13 NOVEMBER 2025, 13:00**.

## Principles and Independent Learning Objectives (ILOs)

You should bear in mind the following three principles whilst completing your project:
1. You will be performing **self-directed, independent work**. You are responsible for every part of the project from planning, execution and submission. It is _your_ project.
2. You will be working on an **in-depth, challenging project**. Your supervisor will ensure that the project is appropriate and relevant.
3. You will need to demonstrate the ILOs which have been designed to match graduate Computer Science Jobs:
  * Demonstrate understanding of research-level material
  * Identify a well-motivated, scientifically interesting challenge.
  * Engage in a suitable approach to solving said challenge.
  * Critically evaluate your solution in a suitable manner.
  * Present your results in written and verbal form.
  * Manage your own time, and decide your own objectives.
