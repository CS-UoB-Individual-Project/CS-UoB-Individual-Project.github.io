# Assessment Information

The **project deadline is 4th May 2026**. Submission consists of your dissertation (compulsory) and any auxiliary material (e.g. code), and the submission is digital only.

**Only the dissertation and viva are marked**, so you may have completed an amazing project, but with a poor dissertation you can still fail the project - so make sure you start writing early, get feedback from your supervisor and leave enough time to focus on writing up the evaluation and conclusion.

Your project will be marked by your supervisor (first marker) and a second marker who isn't involved with the project.
You will have the chance to talk to your second marker about your project at Poster Day and they will hold the viva with you.

## Marking Process

Both your markers will come up with mark suggestions independently. They will do so from reading the thesis and watching/conducting your viva.

Once both mark suggestions have been submitted, these will be shared and then both markers will agree on a final mark for the project.

At this stage, feedback for the project will be collated from both markers.

In the (very) rare case that both markers cannot agree on a final mark, a third backup marker will be brought in to contribute to the discussion.

## Viva (Oral Exam)

The second marker will hold your viva which for all purposes is an oral exam.
Vivas are **in-person** and **attendance is mandatory** - you will fail the unit if you are not present.
Most vivas will be on 20th and 21st May 2026, but due to staff availability, some may be on different dates, so **you must be in Bristol for the full exam period (4th-22nd May 2026).**

The viva has several purposes:
* To showcase parts of the project which cannot (easily) be incoporated into the dissertation.
* To get assurance that you have done the work yourself.
* To correct any misunderstandings the second marker may have had about the work.
* To discuss any mistakes or omissions within the dissertation.
* To explore your understanding of the project area.

The viva will start with you giving a 5-10 minute overview of the project. Slides aren't necessary but can be helpful to remind you of what to say.

# Mark Scheme

The pass mark is 40 for BSc projects and 50 for MEng. 

Your project will generally be marked along four pillars:
* Challenge and Achievement
* Technical Approach
* Critical Interpretation
* Report Presentation

These pillars don't represent individual marks that get aggregated, but are guidelines to showcase where a project may lie.


For easier reading, a pdf version of the mark scheme is auto-generated and can be found at [this link](mark_scheme.pdf).

# Example Projects

We have selected a variety of student projects from last year covering a wide range of topics and have grouped them based on their mark. Make sure that you look at projects relevant to your unit code (COMSM0142 should look at COMSM0052 as well, as the unit has only run for 1 year).

* High 2.i (65-68) [example projects](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Class%20Materials/Example%20projects%20-%202.1%20-%2065-69?csf=1&web=1&e=0M683W)
