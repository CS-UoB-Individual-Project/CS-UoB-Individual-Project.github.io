## Finding a Project

## Projects list
The list of Projects is [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/grp-2025-6IndividualProjects_ojufi7-StaffRoom/ETFY0C4wYLlFoH8kwhoooFUBCahjihovB4RZ3E2KHyexVg?e=Awdq2a)

 **This is a non-exhaustive list**, but a starting point to generate ideas.  If you're interested in any of the projects, email the supervisors to set up a meeting to see if you want to work together.   

**Once you have agreed a project with a supervisor**, you will need to complete [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/dMycuMNQiz) by **13 NOVEMBER 2025, 13:00**.

We will hold a **project matching session** in Week 7, where you can talk and discuss potential projects with your supervisor, but you can start talking to supervisors from the start of TB1.


It is a good idea to think about the area and potential supervisors beforehand:

* What areas/units have you most enjoyed?
* What units did you do well in?
* What lecturer(s) would you like to work with?
* Are there areas in Computer Science that you haven't worked on but want to?

The following are good reasons to think carefully before committing to a project:

* The project requires pre-requisite units that you have not completed.
* The project is not within the supervisor's area of expertise so they won't be able to provide the best support.
* The supervisor believes the project you want to work on is not feasible/has too much scope to fit within an individual project.


## Role of the Supervisor

Your supervisor will support your Project and mark it at the end, along with your second marker. They will not do any work for you, or tell you exactly what you should do, but they may have expectations about seeing things like your project plan, dissertation structure, and writing. You should choose your supervisor so that their supervision style matches what you want.

Supervisors will meet you for either half an hour a week or an hour a fortnight during TB2 term time.  It will be your responsibility to set up and attend the meetings. If you don't attend the meetings, your supervisor may not chase you up. You should take control of what you want to discuss at the meetings, so be proactive.  

Supervisors will read and give you feedback on 2-3 pages of your draft dissertation, if you arrange this in advance. 

Some of the supervisors on the list will have already taught you, but most of them won't have.  Don't be afraid to approach supervisors you don't know yet, because they might have exactly the skills/interests you are looking for.  

## Help choosing a Project or Supervisor

If you're not sure what kind of Project to choose, reach out to your personal tutor as soon as possible.  

If you still need help after talking to your tutor, [contact Shawn, Andrew and Sarah](/contact).


## Confirming a Project

You need to confirm your project by  **the end of Friday Week 8**. This will involve agreeing a project name with a supervisor and submitting this in a form. The title and even the overall project can change before the start of TB2, but you will not be able to change your supervisor unless there is a serious issue - if that happens, please [contact Shawn, Andrew and Sarah](/contact).
