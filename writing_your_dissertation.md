# Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using LaTeX
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file.

# Academic Writing support

Academic writing can feel indimidating, especially if you have not done many writing assessments in the past. It's also one of the most important parts of your project, because this is the primary information your markers have.  

We strongly recommend you start writing as early as possible.  One of your first project tasks should be to set up your dissertation template and think about how you could structure your report.  We have examples of previous projects in the [Class Materials pages of the Projects Team](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=iPuTMH) which you can use for inspiration (each example starts with the unit code - COMS30044 is the 20 credit Maths & CS project, so if you are not on that unit, remember these are only half the credits of the other units).

We recommend you show your initial structure to your supervisor and ask them what they would expect to see in a project in your area - and add writing to your project plan as a regular task.  Make the template a living document, adding bullet points of things you've done and want to include on a weekly basis, and start writing in the first few weeks.  You can write an initial Introduction very early, and get started on the Background in the first few weeks, so you can get feedback on your writing from your supervisor.

You will see some optional sessions in your timetable - Writing Workshops by CALD, the Centre for Academic Language & Development, which are workshops specifically for Computer Science Projects students, and Writing Retreats, sessions where you can come and write in a quiet environment with Mike, Sarah and other students, with snacks and support.  

For more support with writing:

* **General Purpose Guide to Academic Writing** by Professor Dave Cliff has some useful useful tips towards how to approach
academic-style writing for Computer Scientists.
* **[Study Skills guides to academic reading, writing, planning your work and more]** - scroll down the page to get the various guides to different topics.  
* **The [University Study Skills team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/study-skills/)** run bookable workshops and tutorials and dropins where they can give you feedback and advice on your writing at any stages. 
* **[University Writing Fellows](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristol-futures/royal-literary-fellows/)** are also available to give you advice on writing and feedback on your drafts.
* **[Wordsmiths](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/WS8RylsNvhtGTXDc?ref=Link)** is a weekly writing group for any Bristol students to come together to give each other tips and feedback on your writing - scroll down to the Study Groups section of the website.


# Dissertation Templates

## LaTeX Dissertation Template

The LaTeX template for the Dissertation can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Class%20Materials/ThesisTemplate%20-%20LaTeX.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=klVsKZ).  

We recommend you use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write in - scroll down on the log-in page to 
'Log in with SSIO' and sign up with your University account.  Save the LaTeX template zip file to your machine, and follow [Overleaf's instructions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Uploading_a_project).  The Dissertation template in the zip file is called ThesisTemplate.tex - click this in the left-hand menu.  

You'll notice that the template has information about what to include in each section.

### Help with LaTex and Overleaf

The University Library Services have a useful [guide to LaTeX and Overleaf](https://bristol.libguides.com/computer-science/latex) and there are helpful guides to Overleaf and LaTeX on the [Overleaf website](https://www.overleaf.com/learn). 

## Word Dissertation Template

The word template for the Dissertation can be found [here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Class%20Materials/ThesisTemplate%20-%20Word.docx?d=w332200b510a34a0889161d287e1b917e&csf=1&web=1&e=VgkZIB).

# Research Support

The [Computer Science Subject Librarian](https://bristol.libguides.com/computer-science) is here to help your research,  They can meet with you, help you get started and even find you papers or other references.  They can help you with research in any subject, not just Computer Science - use the link to make an appointment.  

# Referencing

It doesn't matter which reference style you use, as long as it's consistent.  In general, CS people recommend IEEE - there's a guide on [Cite Them Right](https://www-citethemrightonline-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/category-list?docid=CTRIEEE) which tells you how to reference almost anything you can think of.

[The University Library referencing page]( https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/subject-support/referencing/) his an excellent resource, which we recommend bookmarking.

We strongly recommend you use [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org/), a tool and a file format which are used to describe and process lists of references (mostly in conjunction with LaTeX documents) and a referencing tool like [Mendeley](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/subject-support/libraryskills/referencing/mendeley/) or [EndNote](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/subject-support/libraryskills/referencing/endnote/).  The library has a [guide to using BibTeX with Mendeley and EndNote](https://bristol.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=33098841).
