# Time Management

You should plan for 12 weeks with 40-hour work weeks for all your work in the
Teaching Block. You need to balance your workload between your project, your other unit(s), and the innovation case if
in Year 4.
**You should not *plan* to work every day in TB2**, doing so will likely leave you falling behind, so it's important you build days off into your project plan, and rewards/things you are going to do just for fun.  Ideally you should be doing at least 1 non-study activity a week that's not Computer Science, tht you have to leave the house for.  

Importantly, you should plan for at least 1 week of *disruptions* which could be illnesses, job interviews, computer issues, etc.

# Minimum Viable Product

When planning your project you should define a minimum viable product (MVP).
This should be enough to pass the unit that you will be able to **complete
after around half of your alotted time** and should be discussed with your
supervisor when confirming your project.

If your project is harder than expected, then you have the MVP to fall back on,
otherwise you can add extra features to the MVP to increase the challenge of
your project.

You should be constantly reviewing your progress during TB2, for yourself and
for your supervisor. If you think you cannot finish the MVP **you should let
your supervisor know immediately**.


# Dissertation Writing

When writing your thesis, we **strongly** recommend writing it using LaTeX
unless you are confident writing a large document within microsoft word (or
equivalent). Large files in Word can cause formatting issues or crashes when
saving/loading the project file. There's more information on writing in LaTeX, including a dissertation template, below. 

# Academic Writing support

Academic writing can feel indimidating, especially if you have not done many
writing assessments in the past. It's also one of the most important parts of
your project, because this is the primary information your markers have.  

We strongly recommend you start writing as early as possible. One of your first
project tasks should be to set up your dissertation template and think about
how to structure your report. We have examples of previous projects in
the [Projects
Team filestore]([https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-2024-5IndividualProjects2/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=iPuTMH](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/grp-2025-6IndividualProjects_ojufi7/Shared%20Documents/General?csf=1&web=1&e=HJjmhi))
which you can use for inspiration (each example starts with the unit code -
note that COMS30044 is the 20 credit Maths & CS project worht half of the other
units).

We recommend you show your initial structure to your supervisor they can give
you tips on what they would expect. Make the template a living document,
adding bullet points of things you've done and want to include on a weekly
basis, and start writing in the first few weeks.  You can write an initial
Introduction very early, and get started on the Background in the first few
weeks, so you can get feedback on your writing from your supervisor.

You will see some optional sessions in your timetable - Writing Workshops by
CALD, the Centre for Academic Language & Development, which are workshops
specifically for Computer Science Projects students, and Writing Retreats,
sessions where you can come and write in a quiet environment with Shawn, Andrew, Sarah
and other students, with snacks and support.  

For more support with writing:

* **[General Purpose Guide to Academic Writing](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/grp-2025-6IndividualProjects_ojufi7/Shared%20Documents/General/TipsOnWriting.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=4WtONs)** by Professor Dave Cliff has some useful useful tips towards how to approach
academic-style writing for Computer Scientists.
* **[Study Skills guides to academic reading, writing, planning your work and more](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/study-skills)** - scroll down the page to get the various guides to different topics.  
* **The [University Study Skills team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/study-skills/)** run bookable workshops and tutorials and dropins where they can give you feedback and advice on your writing at any stages. 
* **[University Writing Fellows](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/bristol-futures/royal-literary-fellows/)** are also available to give you advice on writing and feedback on your drafts.
* **[Wordsmiths](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-support/study-skills/#groups)** is a weekly writing group for any Bristol students to come together to give each other tips and feedback on your writing - scroll down to the Study Groups section of the website.


# Dissertation Templates

## LaTeX Dissertation Template

The LaTeX template for the Dissertation can be found [here](https://github.com/CS-UoB-Individual-Project/Dissertation-template).  

We recommend you use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write in - scroll
down on the log-in page to 'Log in with SSIO' and sign up with your University
account.  Save the LaTeX template zip file above to your machine, and follow
[Overleaf's
instructions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Uploading_a_project).  The
Dissertation template in the zip file is called ThesisTemplate.tex - click this
in the left-hand menu.  

You'll notice that the template has information about what to include in each
section. Note that certain sections are compulsory and cannot be changed, but
feel free to change the other sections based on your project.

### Help with LaTex and Overleaf

The University Library Services have a useful [guide to LaTeX and
Overleaf](https://bristol.libguides.com/computer-science/latex) and there are
helpful guides to Overleaf and LaTeX on the [Overleaf
website](https://www.overleaf.com/learn). 

## Word Dissertation Template

The word template for the Dissertation can be found
[here](https://uob.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/grp-2025-6IndividualProjects_ojufi7/Shared%20Documents/General/ThesisTemplate%20-%20Word.docx?d=w7588be54ec12404d98a3186c71ddb167&csf=1&web=1&e=gIWzGD).

# Research Support

The [Computer Science Subject
Librarian](https://bristol.libguides.com/computer-science) is here to help your
research.  They can meet with you, help you get started and even find you
papers or other references.  They can help you with research in any subject,
not just Computer Science - use the link to make an online appointment, or [email Victoria Hopton](mailto:victoria.hopton@bristol.ac.uk) if you want to make an in-person appointment.

# Referencing

Whenever you look at an article, book, paper, website, video, podcast etc for
your project, **make sure you record them and reference them in your work**.
Failure to do so will count as academic misconduct.

We recommend you use [BibTeX](https://www.bibtex.org/), a tool and a file
format which are used to describe and process lists of references (mostly in
conjunction with LaTeX documents) and a referencing tool like
[Mendeley](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/subject-support/libraryskills/referencing/mendeley/)
or
[EndNote](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/subject-support/libraryskills/referencing/endnote/)
to organise your references.  The library has a [guide to using BibTeX with
Mendeley and EndNote](https://bristol.libguides.com/ld.php?content_id=33098841)
so you can keep track of references in Mendeley and then export them into
BibTeX to seamlessly integrate them into your report. 

It doesn't matter which referencing style you use, as long as it's consistent.
In general, CS people recommend IEEE - there's a guide on [Cite Them
Right](https://www-citethemrightonline-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/category-list?docid=CTRIEEE)
which tells you how to reference almost anything you can think of. We recommend
you use the [DOI link](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/) for
online articles and hyperlink for webpages, so it is easy for your markers to
follow your references to the source.  

[The University Library referencing page]( https://www.bristol.ac.uk/library/subject-support/referencing/) is a great resource, which we recommend bookmarking.
